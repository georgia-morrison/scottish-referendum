# The Scottish Referendum Report

## Section 1 – The Scottish Referendum
### 1.1	– Introduction
### In 2014, Scotland held a referendum in order to determine whether or not Scotland should leave the UK and become an independent state. The data this report will be examines voting patterns based on a series of variables. This report will focus on comparing the percentage of people voting No against unemployment rates, national identity and age. Similarly, this report will compare the turnout of voters against the same three variables. The data in each case is categorised by Scottish Council Area.

### 1.2 - Voting Plots

Figure 1: A scatter plot comparing the percentage of voters voting No in the Scottish Referendum against the unemployment rate. The size of the points is proportionate to the number of voters in the council area.

Figure 2: The sames scatterplot as Figure 1, however each point in respersented by the name of the council area the data shows.

Figure 1 demonstrates that there is a negative correlation between the percentage of voters voting No and the unemployment rate of an area. It is a general trend that the lower the unemployment rate, the more voters are not in favour of Scottish Independence. Comparing this with Figure 2 we see a geographical pattern. Council areas in the Central Scotland have a higher percentage of voters voting No, with a few exceptions such as West Dumbartonshire, Glasgow and North Lanarkshire. As a result, in general, it can be seen that areas around Glasgow tend to have a higher unemployment rate, again with some exceptions as mentioned previously. Dundee is also an anomaly, although it is East coast it has high levels of deprivation.
